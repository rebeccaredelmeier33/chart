    <p>Visits to publicly-funded food pantries and soup kitchens are down nearly 65%, marking the first significant drop in pantry visits since need hit near-record highs during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>However, advocates say the drop doesn’t necessarily mean that need has subsided, but rather that hungry New Yorkers are finding other ways to supplement their food purchases, relying on privately-run food pantries or other resources for their groceries.</p>

    <p>Publicly-funded food pantries, which operate under NYC’s Emergency Food Assistance Program, receive city dollars to stock their shelves. But these food pantries only make up a fraction of the total pantries across the five boroughs, said Molly Horak, communications director at City Harvest, a food access organization that operates across the city.</p>

    <div id=graph>
        <iframe title="Visits to food pantries in New York City's Emergency Food Assistance program " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-O6zSQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O6zSQ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
        </script>
    </div>

    <p>Though the drop in visits to the city-funded pantries could indicate that New Yorkers have been able to get back on their feet since the pandemic's economic fallout, Horak said that small, independently-run food pantries that don't fall under the city's program are still serving considerably high need in their communities. In one <a href="https://www.cityharvest.org/2022/08/hunger-action-month-2022/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20by%20City%20Harvest,from%20January%20to%20June%202022.">analysis from September,</a> the organization found that monthly visits to New York City food pantries and soup kitchens remained 69% higher compared to 2019.</p>

    <p>In Flatbush, the local non-profit organization CAMBA runs a weekly food pantry that still has lines down the block, said Alison Zaccone, the organization’s communications director.</p>

    <p>“Our Beyond Hunger Food Pantry is still serving considerably more people than it was pre-pandemic,” Zaccone said. “This issue is further compounded not only by inflation, but by the disproportionate impact increased food prices have on people who are already so close to the margins.”</p>

    <p>Rabbi Schlomo Nisanov of the Kehilat Sephardim Synagogue in Kew Gardens, Queens, said the same is true at the food pantry the synagogue runs.</p>

    <p>“We’re in a very scary situation,” Nisanov said. “We have people struggling to feed the most vulnerable, babies, and senior citizens, who are homebound and rely on themselves to take care of them, which is very scary. I feel like things are going to get harder and harder to get by.”</p>

    <p>The city’s Human Resources Administration, which runs the Emergency Food Assistance Program, did not respond to a request for comment before time of publication.</p>
